      "abstract": "The paper considers a model in which an imperfectly competitive manufacturing sector produces goods which are used both for final consumption and as intermediates. Intermediate usage creates cost and demand linkages between firms and a tendency for manufacturing agglomeration. How does globalization affect the location of manufacturing and the gains from trade? At high transport costs all countries have some manufacturing industry, but when transport costs fall below a critical value a core-periphery pattern forms spontaneously, and nations that find themselves in the periphery suffer a decline in real income. As transport costs continue to fall there comes a second stage of convergence in real incomes, in which the peripheral nations gain and the core nations may well lose.",

      },
      "abstract": "This paper is an effort to do international trade theory without mentioning countries. Nearly all models of the international economy assume that trade takes place between nations or regions which are themselves dimensionless points. We develop a model in which economic space is instead assumed to be continuous, and in which this `seamless world' spontaneously organizes itself into industrial and agricultural zones because of the tension between forces of agglomeration and disagglomeration. One might expect such a model to be analytically intractable, but we are able to gain considerable insight through a combination of simulations and an analytical approach originally suggested in a biological context by Alan Turing.",

      "abstract": "This paper analyses economic integration between two economies; one central, with a large local market, and the other peripheral, with a small local market. Each economy has an imperfectly competitive manufacturing sector. Trade liberalization creates a strong incentive for the imperfectly competitive industry to concentrate in the central region, near the large market. This may cause the direction of net trade to be the opposite of that predicted by factor endowments. This effect may be offset by a lower wage in the periphery than in the centre; we find that in the early stages of integration relative wages in the centre and periphery diverge, with convergence occurring only in the later stages.",

      "abstract": "The desire to avoid speculative runs on currencies appears to be one of the main reasons leading policy-makers to impose currency bands, but the standard analysis of target zones rules out any speculative inefficiencies by assumption. As an alternative we first present simple models of excess volatility due to stop-loss trading and then go on to consider what target zones might accomplish in this context. The principal result is that the speculation of informed traders shifts from being destabilizing to stabilizing, once the target zone assures them that stop-loss orders will not be triggered.",

Since then, there has been growing concern over disincentive effects of social insurance. This paper suggests that the problem may have arisen in part because European nations were in effect trying to fight market tendencies towards increased inequality. In the United States, with its much more limited welfare state, there has been a striking rise in inequality; a stylized model suggests that the response of redistributive states to these same market forces could have led to a considerable fall in employment.",

      "abstract": "The paper considers the equilibrium location of two industries in two countries. Both industries are imperfectly competitive and produce goods which are used in final consumption and as intermediates by firms in the same industry. Intermediate usage creates cost and demand linkages between firms and a tendency for agglomeration of each industry. When trade barriers are high the equilibrium involves division of both industries between both locations in order to meet the final demands of consumers. At lower trade barriers agglomeration forces dominate and the equilibrium involves specialization, with each industry concentrated in a single location. Economic integration may induce specialization. The paper studies the simple dynamics of the model and demonstrates that during the adjustment process a sizeable proportion of the labour force may suffer lower real wages as relocation of industry occurs, although there are long-run gains from integration.",

      "abstract": "This paper considers tax competition and tax harmonization in the presence of agglomeration forces and falling trade costs. With agglomerative forces operating, industry is not indifferent to location in equilibrium, so perfectly mobile capital becomes a quasi-fixed factor. This suggests that the tax game is something subtler than a race to the bottom. Advanced 'core' nations may act like limit-pricing monopolists toward less advanced 'periphery' countries. Consequently, integration need not lead to falling tax rates, and might well be consistent with the maintenance of large welfare states. &quot;Limit taxing&quot; also means that that simple tax harmonization - adoption of a common tax rate - always harms at least one nation and adoption of a rate between the two unharmonised rates harms both nations. A tax floor set at the lowest equilibrium tax rate leads to a weak Pareto improvement.",

It develops a three-country model of payments equilibrium with transaction costs, and shows how one currency can emerge as an international medium of exchange. Transaction costs are then made endogenous, and it is shown how the underlying structure of payments limits, without necessarily completely determining, the choice and role of a vehicle currency. Finally, a dynamic model is developed, and the way in which one currency can displace another as the international medium of exchange is explored.",

      "abstract": "This paper is an attempt to examine some of the microeconomic foundations of this last view of the link between current accounts and exchange rata. Several authors, especially Kouri and de Macedo (1978), but also more recently Dornbusch (1980), have sought to justify the portfolio approach in terms of finance theory, deriving asset demands from a mean-variance framework and arguing that differences in the portfolios of different countries explain why changes in the world distribution of wealth affect exchange rates. What I will do in this paper is to argue that, even under seemingly favorable assumptions, these distribution effects nay run the wrong way; that if they run the right way, they will be very weak; and that the incentives for inter-national, portfolio diversification are in any case small, and can be swamped by quite modest transaction costs or other costs to diversification.",

      "abstract": "Conventional analysis of the welfare effects of U.S. oil price regulation in the 1970's focuses on the deadweight losses in the oil market. This paper argues that such analysis substantially understates the benefits from decontrolling prices, because decontrol will lead to an improvement in the U.S. terms of trade with respect to other oil importing countries. A simple model of the relationship between oil decontrol and the terms of trade is developed, and the impact is calculated for plausible parameter values. The results suggest that the terms of trade benefits are several times larger than the benefits as conventionally measured.",

Uncertainty gives rise to a meaningful portfolio choice between money and bonds. We show that monetary velocity is increasing in the rate of inflation, and that the optimal monetary policy is that which maximizes real balances. We also show that the real rate of interest is not invariant to monetary policy: inflation lowers the real rate.",

The model shows how such rivalry naturally gives rise to &quot;dumping&quot; of output in foreign markets, and shows that such dumping can be &quot;reciprocal&quot; -- that is, there may be two-way trade in the same product. Reciprocal dumpingis shown to be possible for fairly general specification of firm behaviour.The welfare effects of this seemingly pointless trade are ambiguous. On one hand, resources are wasted in the cross-handling of goods; on the other hand, increased competition reduces monopoly distortions. Surprisingly,in the case of free entry and Cournot behaviour reciprocal dumping is unanibiuously beneficial.",

      "abstract": "Increasing returns are as fundamental a cause of international trade as comparative advantage, but their role has until recently been neglected because of the problem of modelling market structure. Recently substantial theoretical progress has been made using three different approaches. These are the Marshallian approach, where economies of scale are assumed external to firms; the Chamberlinian approach, where imperfect competition takes the relatively tractable form of monopolistic competition; and the Cournot approach of noncooperative quantity-setting firms. This paper surveys the basic concepts and results of each approach. It shows that some basic insights are not too sensitive to the particular model of market structure. Although much remains to be done, we have made more progress toward a general analysis of increasing returns and trade than anyone would have thought possible even a few years ago.",

This paper begins with an investigation of the actual extent of &quot;pricing to market&quot; by foreign suppliers. It shows that pricing to market is a real phenomenon, but not universal; in particular, evidence on German export prices suggests that stickiness of import prices is largely confined to machinery and transport equipment. The paper then considers a number of possible models. While the evidence is not sufficient to distinguish among thesemodels, it seems probable that a full explanation will involve both dynamics and imperfect competition.",

The model is quantified by calibrating its parameters to reproduce the US-Japanese rivalry in 16K R.A.Ms from 1978-1983. We then ask the following question: how much did the apparent closure of the Japanese market to imports affect Japan's export performance? A simulation analysis suggests that a protected home market was a crucial advantage to Japanese firms, which would otherwise have been uncompetitive both at home and abroad. We find, however, that Japan's home market protection nonetheless produced more costs than benefits for Japan.",

      },
      "abstract": "This paper argues that Japan's export growth is likely to slow sharply over the next few years, perhaps to zero. For the past dozen years Japan's export volume has gown much more rapidly than her domestic production. This divergence was made necessary primarily by rising oil prices, and secondarily by a shift into current account surplus. Now both these factors are running in reverse. If Japan's export growth does slow sharply, the mechanism will be a very strong yen -- probably above 140. The paper argues that it is Japan's export growth rather than static trade structure that is the main cause of trade tension, so these developments should lead to a considerable reduction in trade friction.",

We begin with partial models in which large exchange rate fluctuations lead to entry or exit decisions that are not reversed when the currency returns to its previous level. When we develop a simple model of the feedback from &quot;hysteresis&quot; in trade to the exchange rate itself.

This paper presents an approach to modeling the effects of trigger strategists, with emphasis on how target zones affect market expectations. It is shown that a commitment to defend a target zone will generate stabilizing expectations within the band, which may generate a &quot;target zone honeymoon&quot; . an extended period in which the announcement of a target. zone stabilizes exchange rates without any need for action on the part of authorities. However, an imperfectly credible target zone is vulnerable to crises in which the market tests the authorities' resolve.",

The extent of stabilization can be related in a straightforward way to three factors: the sensitivity of the current exchange rate to expected depreciation, the volatility of the process driving exchange rate &quot;fundamentals&quot;, and the credibility of the commitment by authorities to defend the target zone.",

The economy is subject to capital flows that are unpredictable and are perceived as having only limited persistence. The model shows that both the fact that capital flows are perceived as temporary and uncertainty per se act to limit the responsivesness of resource reallocation to real exchange rate movements. In turn, this reluctance of factors to move widens the range of real exchange rate variation, so that larger movements of the real exchange rate are needed to accommodate transitory, unpredictable capital flows than would be required to accommodate persistent, predictable flows of the same magnitude. The model also shows that large capital inflows that lead to real exchange rate appreciation large enough to induce resource reallocation will typically be followed by a depreciation of the real exchange rate to below its original level.",

In its place there have been a number of bilateral and regional moves toward liberalization. Some have been concerned that these local deals may, by undermining the multilateral process, actually reduce world trade and welfare. This paper develops a simple model of the effects of regional trading blocs, and shows that consolidation of the world into a smaller number of such blocs may indeed reduce welfare, even when each bloc acts to maximize the welfare of its members. Indeed, for all plausible parameter values world welfare is minimized when there are three trading blocs. More complex versions of the model offer softer results, but the main thrust is still to validate concern over the effects of bilateral and regional trade deals.",

      "abstract": "The actual value added tax systems used in many countries differ significantly from the completely general VAT that has been the focus of most economic analyses. In practice, VAT systems exempt broad classes of consumer goods and services. This has important implications for the effect of the VAT on international trade. A value added tax is sometimes advocated as a way of improving a country's international competitiveness because GATT rules permit the tax to be levied on imports and rebated on exports. This leads to political support for the VAT among exporters and producers of import-competing products. For a general VAT on all consumption, this argument is incorrect except in the very short run because exchange rates or domestic prices adjust to offset the effect of the tax on the relative prices of domestic and foreign goods. When prices or exchange rates have adjusted, a general value added tax will have no effect on imports and exports. In practice, the value added tax frequently exempts housing and many personal services. The VAT thus raises the price of tradeables relative to nontradeables and induces a substitution of housing and services for tradeable goods. Since this implies a reduced consumption of imported goods, it also implies a decline in exports. The most likely effect of the introduction of a VAT would thus be a decline of exports.",

The location of agricultural production is fixed, but ionopolistcally competitive manufacturing finns choose their location to maximize profits. If transportation costs are high, returns to scale weak, and the share of spending on manufactured goods low, the incentive to produce close to the market leads to an equal division of manufacturing between the regions. With lower transport costs, stronger scale economies, or a higher manufacturing share, circular causation sets in: the more manufacturing is located in one region, the larger that region's share of demand, and this provides an incentive to locate still more manufacturing there. Thus when the parameters of the economy lie even slightly on one side of a critical &quot;phase boundary&quot;, all manufacturing production ends up concentrated in only one region.",

When such a change occurs, leading nations may have no incentive to adopt the new ideas; given their extensive experience with older technologies, the new ideas do not initially seem to be an improvement. Lagging nations, however, have less experience; the new techniques offer them an opportunity to use their lower wages, to break into the market. If the new techniques eventually prove to be more productive than the old, there is a reversal of leadership.",

Simulations suggest, however, that the structures that emerge are surprisingly orderly, and often seem approximately to follow simple rules about the spacing of urban sites. This paper offers an explanation in terms of the process by which a spatial economy diverges away from an even distribution of activity across the landscape. It shows that a small divergence of activity away from spatial uniformity, even if it is highly irregular, can be regarded as the sum of a number of simple periodic fluctuations at different spatial 'wavelengths'; these fluctuations grow at different rates. There is a particular 'preferred wavelength' that grows fastest; provided that the initial distribution of activity across space is flat enough, this preferred wavelength eventually dominates the spatial pattern and becomes the typical distance between cities. The approach suggests that surprisingly simple principles of self-organization may lie beneath the surface of models that appear at first to yield hopelessly complex possibilities.",

These studies have, however, been subjected to severe and in some cases harshly worded criticism by trade theorists, who argue that the authors of these studies have misspecified the impacts of both technology and trade on factor prices. This paper shows that it is the critics who are confused. In particular, much recent discussion about technology, trade, and wages is marked by a failure to distinguish between the models we all use and the particular thought experiments we typically use to teach these models -- which happen not to be the appropriate thought experiments we need to analyze the real-world issues.",

      "abstract": "As the example of Silicon Valley makes clear, the economic analysis of location--the geography of the economy--is the subfield of economics to which the typical buzzwords of complexity apply most obviously and dramatically. The spatial economy is, self-evidently, a self-organizing system characterized by path dependence; it is a domain in which the interaction of individual decisions produces unexpected emergent behavior at the aggregate level; its dynamic landscapes are typically rugged, and the evolution of the spatial economy typically involves &quot;punctuated equilibria,&quot; in which gradual change in the driving variables leads to occasional discontinuous change in the resulting behavior. And in economic geography, as in many physical sciences, there are puzzling empirical regularities--like the startlingly simple law that describes city sizes--which seem to imply higher level principles at work. There is a long intellectual tradition in economic geography (or rather several separate but convergent traditions). The last few years have, however, seen a considerable acceleration of work, especially in the development of theoretical models of the emergence of spatial structure. This paper is a brief but I hope suggestive survey of this work, intended to convey a flavor of the exciting ideas being developed without going into technical detail. The paper is in five parts. I begin with two very simple motivating models that illustrate why economic geography so naturally leads to the typical &quot;complexity&quot; themes. Each of the next three parts then describes a particular major line of research. A final part discusses implications and directions for future work.",

With agglomerative forces operating, industry is not indifferent to location in equilibrium, so perfectly mobile capital becomes a quasi-fixed factor. This suggests that the tax game is something subtler than a race to the bottom. Advanced 'core' nations may act like limit-pricing monopolists toward less advanced 'periphery' countries. Consequently, integration need not lead to falling tax rates, and might well be consistent with the maintenance of large welfare states. ‘Limit taxing’ also means that simple tax harmonization – adoption of a common tax rate – always harms at least one nation and adoption of a rate between the two unharmonized rates harms both nations. A tax floor set at the lowest equilibrium tax rate leads to a weak Pareto improvement.",

      "abstract": "There is a widespread view that world payments imbalances can be remedied through increased demand in surplus countries and reduced demand in deficit countries, without any need for real exchange rate changes. In fact shifts in demand and real exchange rate adjustment are necessary couplets, not substitutes. The essential reason for this complementarity is that a much higher fraction of a marginal dollar of US than of foreign spending falls on US output. As a result, a redistribution of world spending away from the US leads to an excess supply of US goods unless accompanied by a decline in their relative price. Although some economists believe that the integration of world capital markets somehow eliminates this problem, this is a fallacy that confuses accounting identities with behavior. The paper also addresses a number of relates issues, such as the role of budget deficits in determining domestic demand and the effectiveness of nominal exchange rates changes in producing real depreciation.",

      "abstract": "One might expect that differences in income elasticities in trade and/or differences in growth rates among countries would give rise to strong secular trends in real exchange rates; for example, fast-growing countries might need steady depreciation to get the world to accept their growing exports. In fact, however, income elasticities are systematically related to growth rates by the &quot;45-degree rule&quot;, under which fast-growing countries appear to face high income elasticities of demand for their exports, while having low income elasticities of import demand. The net effect of this relationship between elasticities and growth rates is that secular trends in real exchange rates are much smaller than one might otherwise have expected: relative PPP holds fairly well. This paper documents the existence of a &quot;45-degree rule&quot;, and suggests an explanation in terms of increasing returns and product differentiation.",

Closer integration may result first in a race to the top' and then a race to the bottom, a result that is consistent with recent empirical work showing that the tax gap between rich and poor nations follows a bell-shaped path (Devereux, Griffith and Klemm 2002). Moreover, split-the-difference tax harmonization can make both nations worse off. This may help explain why tax harmonisation which is Pareto improving in the standard model is so difficult in the real world. The key theoretical insight is that agglomeration forces create quasi-rents that can be taxed without inducing delocation. This suggests that the tax game is something subtler than a race to the bottom. Advanced 'core' nations may act like limit-pricing monopolists toward less advanced 'periphery' countries. Since agglomeration rents are a bell-shaped function of the level of integration, the equilibrium tax gap in our tax game is also bell shaped.",

The paper shows that such sustained dollar strength would lead the U.S. to Latin American levels of debt relative to GNP, which is presumably not feasible.

This paper, after reviewing the rationale for the orthodox strategy of concerted lending and the case for debt forgiveness, examines the logic behind several market-based debt reduction schemes. It shows that such schemes will ordinarily benefit both debtor and creditor only when the debtor is on the wrong side of the &quot;debt relief Laffer curve&quot; -- that is, where a reduction in nominal claims actually increases expected payment. This is, however, also the case in which unilateral debt forgiveness is in the interest of creditors in any case. The implication is that there is no magic in market-based debt reduction, as opposed to more straightforward approaches.",

      "abstract": "This paper examines the tradeoffs facing creditors of a country whose debt is large enough that the country cannot attract voluntary new lending. If the country is unable to meet its debt service requirements out of current income, the creditors have two choices. They can finance the country, lending at an expected loss in the hope that the country will eventually be able to repay its debt after all; or they can forgive, reducing the debt level to one that the country can repay. The post-1983 debt strategy of the IMF and the US has relied on financing, but many current calls for debt reform call for forgiveness instead. The paper shows that the choice between financing and forgiveness represents a tradeoff. Financing gives the creditors an option value: if the country turns out to do relatively well, creditors will not have written down their claims unnecessarily. However, the burden of debt distorts the country's incentives, since the benefits of good performance go largely to creditors rather than itself. The paper also shows that the tradeoff itself can be improved if both financing and forgiveness are made contingent on states of nature that the country cannot affect, such as oil prices, world interest rates, etc.",

The model shows that the direction of this effect depends on a comparison of the direct balance of payments burden of the higher oil price with the indirect balance of payments benefits of OPEC spending and investment. In the short run, what matters is whether the U.S. share of world oil imports is more or less than its share of OPEC asset holdings; in the long run, whether its share of oil imports is more or less than its share of OPEC imports. Casual empiricism suggests that the initial effect and the long run effect will run in opposite directions: an oil price increase will initially lead to dollar appreciation, but eventually leads to dollar depreciation.",

This paper develops a model which attempts to explain this observation, while at the same time making sense of some other puzzling empirical aspects of world trade. The basis of the model is a distinction between two kinds of trade: &quot;Heckscher-Ohlin&quot; trade, based on differences in factor proportions, and &quot;intraindustry&quot; trade, based on scale economies and product differentiation. To incorporate intraindustry trade into the model it is necessary to drop the usual assumptions of constant returns to scale and perfect competition; instead the paper deals with a world where economies of scale are pervasive and all firms possess some monopoly power. Surprisingly, it is nonetheless possible to develop a fully-worked-out general equilibrium model which remains simple and can be used to compare autarky and free trade. Two main results emerge from the analysis. First, the nature of trade depends on how similar countries are in their factor endowments. As countries become more similar, the trade between them will increasingly become intra-industry in character. Second, the effects of opening trade depend on its type. If intraindustry trade is sufficiently dominant the advantages of extending the market will outweigh the distributional effects, and the owners of scarce as well as of abundant factors will be made better off.",

Both industries are imperfectly competitive and produce goods which are used in final consumption and as intermediates by firms in the same industry. Intermediate useage creates cost and demand linkages between firms and a tendency for agglomeration of each industry. When trade barriers are high the equilibrium involves division of both industries between both locations in order to meet the final demands of consumers. At lower trade barriers agglomeration forces dominate the equilibrium involves specialisation, with each industry concentrated in a single location. Economic integration may induce specialisation. The paper studies the simple dynamics of the model and demonstrates that during adjustment processes a sizable proportion of the labour force may suffer lower real wages as relocation of industry occurs, although there are long run gains from integration.",

Segundo, trata de explicar porque la definición del problema económico como de competencia internacional es sin embargo tan atractivo a tanta gente. Finalmente, argumenta que la obsesión respecto a la competitividad es no solamente errada sino peligrosa, que distorsiona las políticas económicas internas y amenaza el sistema económico internaciona1. Este último postulado es, desde luego, el más implicativo desde el punto de vista político. Pensar en términos de competitividad conduce directa e indirectamente a malas políticas económicas en un amplio rango de asuntos internos y externos, ya se trate de salud o de comercio.",

Making some agents debt-constrained is a surprisingly powerful assumption: Fisherian debt deflation, the possibility of a liquidity trap, the paradox of thrift, a Keynesiantype multiplier, and a rationale for expansionary fiscal policy all emerge naturally from the model. We argue that this approach sheds considerable light both on current economic difficulties and on historical episodes, including Japan's lost decade (now in its 18th year) and the Great Depression itself.",

      "abstract": "These document contains three parts: the first part focuses on the lessons that have been learnt from the 2007-2009 crisis and how economic authorities handled the shock suffered in most variables. The conclusion is that Government intervention through fiscal policy is the only wayto offset the weakness of households and firms. Monetary policy on the other hand can help, but it has limits in its ability to become a real source of economic growth. The second part makes a short review on current economic affairs including a discussion on whether the crisis has ended.Krugman accepts that the crisis is over, but he believes that we are still far from an economic expansion. Finally, the article analyzes the economic situation of Latin America and Colombia in particular. It points out that this crisis did not start in our countries and it did not happen because of bad economic policies as it used to happen in previous crisis in emerging economies. The crisis had an impact on these countries because of its effects on trade, commodities and capital flows due to the lower economic activity in developed countries. However we have evidence of strengthin developing countries.Este documento se enfoca inicialmente en las lecciones aprendidas a partir de los sucesos que provocaron la crisis de la economía mundial de los años 2008-2009 y la forma como se ha manejado por parte de las autoridades económicas en los Estados Unidos y a nivel mundial, planteandola importancia de la intervención del Gobierno y los obstáculos de la política monetaria como fuentes de crecimiento y recuperación en este período. La segunda parte interpreta los acontecimientos actuales y discute la tesis de que Krugman acepta que ya ha habido una salida a lacrisis ocurrida en el verano de 2009, pero todavía estamos lejos de una economía en expansión. Por último el artículo se ocupa de la situación de América Latina y Colombia en particular y señala que esta crisis no surgió de malos manejos económicos sino de ",

The straightforward economic answer is that this makes little sense: neither the gains from trade nor the gains from appropriate regulation are compromised if other countries impose standards that are weaker than your own. It is possible to offer second-bet economic rationales for harmonization, but these are empirically unconvincing. The only serious argument in favor or regulation is political: that regulation which is in the national interest may not be politically feasible unless other countries do the same.",

By the early 1990s, however, almost everyone believed that the age of U.S. supremacy was nearing its end. Circa 1992 few people would have dared to suggest that a second &quot;American Century&quot; might be in prospect. At the millennium, however, such suggestions are indeed being made. Several years of extremely favorable U.S. economic performance, all the more dramatic in contrast to some of the crises and setbacks elsewhere, have made it seem possible that American supremacy, far from being further eroded, will return to something like its early post-World War II levels. But can America really stay on top? To raise this question is not in any sense to accept the idea that the world economy is a zero-sum game; if America does well, this is not bad news for the rest of the world, nor is a renewed supremacy based on dismal performance elsewhere good for us. But it is still interesting to ask whether the special position of the United States in the world economy has gained a new lease on life.",

At some point this bubble will burst, leading to a sharp fall in the dollar's value.The essential argument is that given the modest real interest differentials between the U.S. and its trading partners, the dollar'sstrength amounts to an implicit forecast on the part of the market that with high probability the dollar will remain very strong for an extended period. The paper shows that such sustained dollar strength would lead the U.S. to Latin American levels of debt relative to GNP, which is presumably not feasible. Allowing for the possibility that something will be done to bring the dollar down before this happens actually reinforces the argument that the current value of the dollar is unreasonable.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>",

      "abstract": "Twenty years ago, on the eve of the first of the great post-Bretton Woods recessions, unemployment did not appear to be a major problem for advanced economies. Today, of course, unemployment is back with a vengeance. In Europe, in particular, the seemingly inexorable rise in the unemployment rate has led to the creation of a new word: Eurosclerosis. While the United States has not seen a comparable upward trend, many people on both sides of the Atlantic believe the United States has achieved low unemployment by a sort of devil's bargain, whose price is soaring inequality and growing poverty.> Why has unemployment risen? Will it continue to rise? What can be done to reverse the trend? These daunting questions have been the subject of massive amounts of research. Many economists have coalesced around a common view of the nature of the unemployment problem. In his remarks before the bank's 1994 symposium, Krugman restates that conventional wisdom.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>",

Yet while thinking about micro-foundations is a productive enterprise, complex models based on such foundations are not necessarily more accurate than simple, ad-hoc models. Three decades of attempts to base aggregate supply on rational behaviour have not displaced the Phillips curve; inter-temporal models of consumption do not offer reliable predictions about aggregate demand. Meanwhile, the ease of use of small models makes them superior for many practical applications. So we should not allow them to be driven out of circulation.

      "abstract": "This paper considers tax competition and tax harmonization in the presence of agglomeration forces and falling trade costs. With agglomerative forces operating, industry is not indifferent to location in equilibrium, so perfectly mobile capital becomes a quasi-fixed factor. This suggests that the tax game is something subtler than a race to the bottom. Advanced 'core' nations may act like limit-pricing monopolists toward less advanced 'periphery' countries. Consequently, integration need not lead to falling tax rates, and might well be consistent with the maintenance of large welfare states. &quot;Limit taxing&quot; also means that that simple tax harmonization - adoption of a common tax rate - always harms at least one nation and adoption of a rate between the two unharmonised rates harms both nations. A tax floor set at the lowest equilibrium tax rate leads to a weak Pareto improvement.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>",

      "abstract": "The paper considers the equilibrium location of two industries in two countries. Both industries are imperfectly competitive and produce goods which are used in final consumption and as intermediates by firms in the same industry. Intermediate usage creates cost and demand linkages between firms and a tendency for agglomeration of each industry. When trade barriers are high the equilibrium involves division of both industries between both locations in order to meet the final demands of consumers. At lower trade barriers agglomeration forces dominate and the equilibrium involves specialization, with each industry concentrated in a single location. Economic integration may induce specialization. The paper studies the simple dynamics of the model and demonstrates that during the adjustment process a sizeable proportion of the labour force may suffer lower real wages as relocation of industry occurs, although there are long-run gains from integration.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>",

With few exceptions, those who use the term have a crude, essentially mercantilist view of world trade, in which competition among nations is just like competition between corporations. Not only do the authors and readers of reports on national competitiveness usually not understand comparative advantage, they are unaware of the most basic adding-up constraints. Economists, however, find it hard to believe that seemingly well-informed people can really be this naive, and assume that there must be more sophisticated ideas lying behind what they say. The rationales offered by economists, in turn, offer false comfort to the would-be sophisticates who like the term &quot;competitiveness&quot;; they believe that they have transcended conventional economic theory, when the fact is that they have failed to comprehend it.

It differs from traditional work in economic geography mainly in adopting a modelling strategy that exploits the same technical tricks that have played such a large role in the 'new trade' and 'new growth' theories; these modelling tricks, while they preclude any claims of generality, do allow the construction of models that--unlike most traditional spatial analysis--are fully general-equilibrium and clearly derive aggregate behaviour from individual maximization. The new work is highly suggestive, particularly in indicating how historical accident can shape economic geography, and how gradual changes in underlying parameters can produce discontinuous change in spatial structure. It also serves the important purpose of placing geographical analysis squarely in the economic mainstream. Copyright 1998 by Oxford University Press.",

We develop a simple theoretical model, inspired by the case of Mexico, that explains the existence of such giant cities as a consequence of the strong forward and backward linkages that arise when manufacturing tries to serve a small domestic market. The model implies that these linkages are much weaker when the economy is open to international trade -- in other words, the giant Third World metropolis is an unintended by-product of import-substitution policies, and will tend to shrink as developing countries liberalize.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>",

These studies have, however, been subjected to severe and in some cases harshly worded criticism by trade theorists, who argue that the authors of these studies have misspecified the impacts of both technology and trade on factor prices. This paper shows that it is the critics who are confused. In particular, much recent discussion about technology, trade, and wages is marked by a failure to distinguish between the models we all use and the particular thought experiments we typically use to teach these models -- which happen not to be the appropriate thought experiments we need to analyze the real-world issues.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>",

Such upheavals may be explained if the advantage of established urban centers rests on localized learning by doing. When a new technology is introduced, for which this accumulated experience is irrelevant, older centers prefer to stay with a technology in which they are more efficient. New centers, however, turn to the new technology and are competitive despite the raw state of that technology because of their lower land rents and wages.

Today, of course, unemployment is back with a vengeance. In Europe, in particular, the seemingly inexorable rise in the unemployment rate has led to the creation of a new word: Eurosclerosis. While the United States has not seen a comparable upward trend, many people on both sides of the Atlantic believe the United States has achieved low unemployment by a sort of devil's bargain, whose price is soaring inequality and growing poverty.> Why has unemployment risen? Will it continue to rise? What can be done to reverse the trend? These daunting questions have been the subject of massive amounts of research. Many economists have coalesced around a common view of the nature of the unemployment problem. In his remarks before the bank's 1994 symposium, Krugman restates that conventional wisdom.",

      "abstract": " For several decades, discretionary fiscal policy has been in disrepute. Most economists viewed it as unnecessary, because monetary policy was up to the job of stabilizing the economy. Economists also viewed fiscal policy as too clumsy to deal with the relatively short recessions that became the post-war norm. But the experience of Japan and the near-Japan experience of the United States in 2001--3 have renewed some of the old case for fiscal policy. Low-interest environments in which monetary policy becomes ineffective turn out to be a real danger, not a myth. Economic slumps that last for a number of years, offering ample time to implement fiscal expansion, also turn out to be possible. As a result, the case for fiscal policy made by the first generation of Keynesians has experienced a real revival. Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press.",

      "abstract": "This paper examines the tradeoffs facing creditors of a country whose debt is large enough that the country cannot attract voluntary new lending. If the country is unable to meet its debt service requirements out of current income, the creditors have two choices. They can finance the country, lending at an expected loss in the hope that the country will eventually be able to repay its debt after all; or they can forgive, reducing the debt level to one that the country can repay. The post-1983 debt strategy of the IMF and the US has relied on financing, but many current calls for debt reform call for forgiveness instead. The paper shows that the choice between financing and forgiveness represents a tradeoff. Financing gives the creditors an option value: if the country turns out to do relatively well, creditors will not have written down their claims unnecessarily. However, the burden of debt distorts the country's incentives, since the benefits of good performance go largely to creditors rather than itself. The paper also shows that the tradeoff itself can be improved if both financing and forgiveness are made contingent on states of nature that the country cannot affect, such as oil prices, world interest rates, etc.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>",

      "abstract": "This paper develops a model where rivalry of oligopolistic firms serves as an independent cause of international trade. The model shows how such rivalry naturally gives rise to &quot;dumping&quot; of output in foreign markets, and show such dumping can be reciprocal -- there may be two-way trade in the same product. Reciprocal dumping is possible for fairly general specifications of firm behaviour. The welfare effects of this seemingly pointless trade are ambiguous: resources are wasted, but increased competition reduces monopoly distortions. Surprisingly, with free entry and Cournot behaviour, reciprocal dumping is unambiguously beneficial.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>",

In fact, however, income elasticities are systematically related to growth rates by the &quot;45-degree rule&quot;, under which fast-growing countries appear to face high income elasticities of demand for their exports, while having low income elasticities of import demand. The net effect of this relationship between elasticities and growth rates is that secular trends in real exchange rates are much smaller than one might otherwise have expected: relative PPP holds fairly well. This paper documents the existence of a &quot;45-degree rule&quot;, and suggests an explanation in terms of increasing returns and product differentiation.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>",

      "abstract": "In a world of high capital mobility, the threat of speculative attack becomes a central issue of macroeconomicpolicy. While “first-generation” and “second-generation” models of speculative attacks both have considerablerelevance to particular financial crises of the 1990s, a “third-generation” model is needed to make sense of thenumber and nature of the emerging market crises of 1997-98. Most of the recent attempts to produce such amodel have argued that the core of the problem lies in the banking system. This paper sketches another candidatefor third-generation crisis modeling—one that emphasizes two facts that have been omitted from formal modelsto date: the role of companies' balance sheets in determining their ability to invest, and that of capital flows inaffecting the real exchange rate.

      "abstract": "America is probably facing a slowdown in the rate of natural population increase and possibly a slowdown in productivity growth. We argue that, if these two factors depress the rate of future economic growth, one cannot assume that the past performance of asset returns is indicative of future results. Simple standard closed-economy growth models predict that a growth slowdown will likely lower the marginal product of capital and thus the long-run rate of return. Moreover, if current asset valuations represent rational expectations, simple arithmetic shows that it is almost impossible for past rates of return to continue through a growth slowdown. In standard models at least, only a large shift in the income distribution toward capital, or future current account surpluses that are larger and more persistent than those that nineteenth-century Britain sustained for generations, give promise for reconciling a future slowdown with a continuation of historical asset returns.",

      "abstract": "İşte George Bush’un Ulusa Seslenişi’nden bir başka doğru olmayan cümle: “Biz inkâr edip görmezden gelerek sorunlarımızı gelecekteki kongrelere, başkanlara ve gelecek nesillere devretmeyeceğiz.” Bay Bush’un adamları, idaresinden sorumlu oldukları kamu borçlarındaki patlamanın bir sorun olmadığını iddia ediyorlar. Kamu borç tahminlerinin bu yıl için 455, gelecek yıl için 475 milyar dolara varmasına rağmen. Ama her zamanki mazeret bulucular bile (hiç olmazsa bazıları) hükümetin sorumsuzca davrandığını kabul etmeye başladılar. Acaba hükümetin yalancılığı ile de mertçe yüzleşebilecekler mi? Hükümetin mali sorumluluk sözünün tahrif edilmiş rakamlara dayandığı, görmek isteyenler için baştan beri âşikardı. Rakamlar meseleyi anlatıyor. Hükümet Nisan 2001’de çıkan ilk bütçede bu yıl için 334 milyar dolarlık bir fazla öngörüyordu. Daha beteri, Şubat 2002’de çıkan ikinci bütçede -yani hükümet 11 Eylül ve ekonomik krizden haberdarken- yaptıkları tahminler bu yıl için sadece 80 milyar dolar bütçe açığı ve gelecek yıl neredeyse denk bir bütçe şeklindeydi . Daha altı ay önce bu yıl ve gelecek yıl bütçe açığının 300 milyar dolar olacağı tahmin ediliyordu. Hükümetin bütçe açığı tahminlerinin neden gerçeklerden bu kadar uzak olduğunu anlamak için kâhin olmaya gerek yok: Gerçekçi bütçe tahminleri, vergi indirimlerini savunmayı zorlaştıracaktı. Bu yüzden bütçe uzmanları gelecekteki gelirleri olduğundan çok daha fazla, gelecekteki harcamaları olduğundan çok daha az gösteren tahminler yapmaya zorlandılar. Bu durumun Irak’ın tehdit oluşturması konusunun abartılmasıyla benzerliği asla rastlantı değil.",

      "abstract": "Thirty years have passed since a small group of theorists began applying concepts and tools from industrial organization to the analysis of international trade. The new models of trade that emerged from that work didn't supplant traditional trade theory so much as supplement it, creating an integrated view that made sense of aspects of world trade that had previously posed major puzzles. The &quot;new trade theory&quot;—an unfortunate phrase, now quite often referred to as &quot;the old new trade theory&quot;—also helped build a bridge between the analysis of trade between countries and the location of production within countries. In this paper I will try to retrace the steps and, perhaps even more important, the state of mind that made this intellectual transformation possible. At the end I'll also ask about the relevance of those once-revolutionary insights in a world economy that, as I'll explain, is arguably more classical now than it was when the revolution in trade theory began.",

Making some agents debt-constrained is a surprisingly powerful assumption. Fisherian debt deflation, the possibility of a liquidity trap, the paradox of thrift and toil, a Keynesian-type multiplier, and a rationale for expansionary fiscal policy all emerge naturally from the model. We argue that this approach sheds considerable light both on current economic difficulties and on historical episodes, including Japan's lost decade (now in its 18th year) and the Great Depression itself.

On the one hand, the New Economic Geography is said to be of less relevance when describing current developments in advanced economies because it focuses more on tangible causes of the spatial concentration of economic activities, and not so much on intangible sources, such as information spillovers. On the other hand, the paper states that recent developments in developing economies like China are quite in line with the core-periphery model that predicts increasing regional specialization as a result of economic integration. Although both economists and geographers study these spatial processes, no fruitful exchange between the two is expected because of the use of different methodologies. [image omitted] Krugman P. La nouvelle geographie economique atteint l'age mur, Regional Studies. Cet article pretend que la nouvelle geographie economique atteint 'l'age mur'. D'un cote, on dit que la nouvelle geographie economique est peu pertinente quant aux developpements des economies avancees parce qu'elle porte plutot sur les causes manifestes de la concentration geographique des activites economiques que sur les sources indefinissables, telles les retombees de l'information. De l'autre cote, l'article affirme que des developpements recents dans les economies avancees, voire la Chine, sont tout a fait en accord avec le modele du centre-peripherie, qui prevoit une augmentation de la specialisation regionale suite a l'integration economique.

Over the longer term, however, the endogenous response of investment, together with increasing returns, may well actually increase real earnings. If immigration itself is not wholly exogenous, but responds to real wages, there may be multiple equilibria. That is, optimism or pessimism about the success of the economy at absorbing immigrants may constitute a self-fulfilling prophecy.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>",

First is the role of economies of scale as a cause of intra-industry trade, modelled using monopolistic competition. Second is the effect of tariffs and quotas on domestic market power. Third is the analysis of dumping as international price discrimination. Fourth is the potential strategy role of government policy as an aid to domestic firms in oligopolistic competition. Finally, the paper discusses recent work that may provide a new argument for protectionism. A concluding section discusses recent efforts at quantification of new trade theory.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>",

      "abstract": "The actual value added tax systems used in many countries differ significantly from the completely general VAT that has been the focus of most economic analyses. In practice, VAT systems exempt broad classes of consumer goods and services. This has important implications for the effect of the VAT on international trade. A value added tax is sometimes advocated as a way of improving a country's international competitiveness because GATT rules permit the tax to be levied on imports and rebated on exports. This leads to political support for the VAT among exporters and producers of import-competing products. For a general VAT on all consumption, this argument is incorrect except in the very short run because exchange rates or domestic prices adjust to offset the effect of the tax on the relative prices of domestic and foreign goods. When prices or exchange rates have adjusted, a general value added tax will have no effect on imports and exports. In practice, the value added tax frequently exempts housing and many personal services. The VAT thus raises the price of tradeables relative to nontradeables and induces a substitution of housing and services for tradeable goods. Since this implies a reduced consumption of imported goods, it also implies a decline in exports. The most likely effect of the introduction of a VAT would thus be a decline of exports.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>",

Using new tools--in particular, modeling techniques developed to analyze industrial organization, international trade, and economic growth--this &quot;new economic geography&quot; has emerged as one of the most exciting areas of contemporary economics. The authors show how seemingly disparate models reflect a few basic themes, and in so doing they develop a common &quot;grammar&quot; for discussing a variety of issues. They show how a common approach that emphasizes the three-way interaction among increasing returns, transportation costs, and the movement of productive factors can be applied to a wide range of issues in urban, regional, and international economics. This book is the first to provide a sound and unified explanation of the existence of large economic agglomerations at various spatial scales.",

An evaluation of the Federal Reserve's role in reining in economic growth to prevent inflation, and the debate over whether its targets are too low. A look at the collapse of the Mexican peso and the burst of Japan's &quot;bubble&quot; economy. A revised discussion of the federal budget deficit, including the growth concern that Social Security and Medicare payments to retiring baby boomers will threaten the solvency of the government. Finally, in the updated concluding section, the author provides three possible scenarios for the American economy over the next decade. He warns us that we live in age of diminished expectations, in which the voting public is willing to settle for policy drift—but with the first baby boomers turning 65 in 2011, the economy will not be able to drift indefinitely.",

In Geography and Trade he provides a stimulating synthesis of ideas in the literature and describes new models for implementing a study of economic geography that could change the nature of the field. Economic theory usually assumes away distance. Krugman argues that it is time to put it back - that the location of production in space is a key issue both within and between nations.",

In the last few years, such a programme has emerged in international monetary economics, which is underpinned by a theoretical framework grounded in stochastic calculus and the increasing prominence in the real world of the international monetary arrangements under which national monetary authorities attempt to keep exchange rates within bands or 'target zones'. This new programme of research also covers switches in exchange rate regimes. This volume from the Centre for economic Policy Research and the National Bureau of Economic Research includes contributions - as authors or discussants - from most of the active participants in the development of this new field, and will serve as a useful introduction and basic text for this new research programme. It opens with an account of the basic economic model of a currency band developed by Paul Krugman, which is followed by two papers that extend this approach. Other chapters study the regime switches entailed in Britain's return to the gold standard in 1925 and the preannounced entry of a floating currency into a band such as the EMS. Essays on sustainability and realignment consider the possible outcomes of speculative attacks on such bands, and the volume ends with a paper on econometric testing of models of this type.",
